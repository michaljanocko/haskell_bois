- Sleeping right under the summit of Velká Deštná with a new thermally isolating lining in the sleeping bag: 9/10
- First mile was just rocks; it was almost impossible to even walk the bike; thank God that I didn't decide to the last mile yesterday evening
- The views…
- Mirinda from a little kiosk at Pěticestí kicks a**
- What? A mountain ridge trail that has asphalt???
- Orlické mountains > Krkonoše mountains
- I'm rolling up my sleeves to get rid of the funny looking farmer's tan
- It seems like everything on this trip must have been purcahsed either in Lidl (like European Target) or Decathlon (cheap sporting goods)
- Combination of wind and upwards incline ought to be banned
- The hill to our cabin is 3× longer than what I remember it to be
- Lunch/dinner at my grandparent's house
- George waited at the cabin. Sleeping.
- BBQ
- We have no dry clothes for George in his size
- Rest of the evening is spent by watching DVTV and just chilling in front of the fireplace
