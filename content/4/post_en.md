- First night in the wild (meh)
- We dramatically underestimated how cold it gets
- We ran out of fuel for our lighter and we still had no fire
- While looking for water, we found only a little in the middle of a random meadow
- Death to all gravel, long live blacktop!
- We made 24 mi before lunch (never again)
- The restaurant _U Bizona_ in Moldava is pretty good
- Michal was appreciating the landscape and ran right into Jirka
- _Ore Mountains_ are gone (finally, after 115 miles)
- The wind makes us 50% slower when ascending and around 30% slower when going downhill
- What looked like it was supposed to be downhill was constantly uphill
- We almost had no dinner, all the stores were closing early
- We bought some stuff at a bordershop. What is it? We don't know. It was cheap.
- Jirka nearly wasn't able to get to the hostel (he arrived after 20 minutes)
- Our election programme:
  1. Ban all slag and clinker from the roads
  2. Wind gusts only in the direction of your ride
  3. Kickstands for all families
  4. Quality panniers (it's not a consumable good!)
	5. Public driers for bikers
