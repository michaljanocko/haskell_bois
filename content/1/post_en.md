- George hurt himself while carrying his bike
- Michael's feet slipped off of the pedals and he fell on the frame of the bike
- We tested our water filter (we're fine so far)
- We forgot both: a sanitizer and a mosquito repelent
- The only opened restaurants in Aš were a random Asian bistro and a bistro in the city park
- It is possible to shower in the rain (speaking from experience)
- While we looked for a place to sleep, all of our stuff got drenched
- Special thanks to the _Bar V Sadu_ for delicious food even before their opening time and the hotel _Pod Komínem_ for letting us sleep on their terrace whose hard bricks I feel on my ribs
