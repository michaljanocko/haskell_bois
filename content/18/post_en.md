- We were woken up by a scream on an unknown creature
- Michael raced to Fulnek. He made it in 7m 17s and won the bet
- Breakfast consisted of an ice-cream from a local convenience store
- We _stole_ water from a pub
- Old turkish saying goes that an unnamed brook is a brook with no name
- We rode through Kunín—no yoghurt there
- We ate at Pizzeria Nano in Nový Jičín; George ordered shrimp pizza, Michael got lasagna
- We resupplied food from Kaufland for banging prices (it was way cheaper than we expected)
- Best resting place: Gazebo right next to the biking trail
- The Beskydy mountains attack
- We went throught a no-bike zone. Nothing can stop us!
- Michael ran out of (not just) energy
- The terminator flies for right for the eyes
- We showered in a waterfall
- George forced us to go 6 more miles at the end of the day. It was worth it. Maybe.
- We acommodated ourselves next to a stream which also served as a perfect fridge (A+++ energy efficiency)
- We ate yoghurts and Kofola (Czech knock off of Coke – and it's actually much better). We wish ourselves pleasant digestion and to our readers as well
