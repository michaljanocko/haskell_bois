- Today was really worth it
- It was pouring the whole night
- Michael's shoes are finally dry
- He still bikes in his "barefoot" shoes; he is saving the better shoes for better days
- Michael's tail light has been for day and a half
- George's light is dead as well; we've already added it to our waitlist of devices for battery transplantation
- GIDDYUP
- Michael has aerodynamic brake like Bugatti Veyron except it's a $4 poncho from Decathlon
- It was nice going downhill to Děčín
- We bought tons of stuff for our next night in the wild
- Sportisimo purchase: 666 CZK
- Fried (rice) noodles
- George's third attempt to buy a kickstand that fits
- On our way to Hřensko, we rode on a 2nd class road where bikes are not allowed go (and it was clear why)
- Well, the ferry was out of order because of the water, so we had no choice
- We got drenched. A lot.
- At 5:30 PM we booked a hostel that was 20 miles away
- Given the circumstances, here was no way we were getting there before 9 PM
- The town of _Hřensko_ was completely flooded
- The water was just rolling down from the hills
- We should have given up on keeping ourselves dry long time ago, it can't get any worse
- Up to 10" of water on the road
- Flooded houses
- We're fording across streets, the bikes are heavy
- Kraken is dragging us down with the current
- We're escaping up onto a hill
- We can hear sirens for evacuation of all people
- We're not making to the hostel
- Michael's front brake was constantly slowing him down; he removed it—an unnecessary part, isn't it?
- We split, Michael goes ahead
- A random guy from _Mlýny_ is wishing us luck while sitting on his fron porch and holding a beer
- 9:01 PM – Michael arrived
- 9:51 PM – George arrived
- George's kickstand fell off (it lasted one afternoon)
- Everything is soaked, EVERYTHING
- Good night
