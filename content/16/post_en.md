elev: "5750 ft up onto Praděd and 5250 ft back down"

- This was the first time we woke up in time (thanks to George's grandma)
- Oil dripped onto our rear brakes; their effectivity was down by 85–100%
- The lesson for next time: use WD-40 only with a long nozzle
- We have to brake with our front brakes; good thing is that with that much weight in the back, we're not flying over the handlebars
- George lost all (but one) of our pears
- Juicy hamburgers for lunch
- A bird shat on George's shoulder
- Michael found the shortcut of the century
- Something thought it was clever to mark a path paved with 1' rocks as a bike trail
- We don't what bike the author had but we suppose it was a model T-34
- Our clothing has been washed but we already smell like vinegar again
- There are sweat streams running down our faces and which are indistinguishable from little insects sitting on your face (it's annoying)
- We're signing actual contracts in 4300 ft a. s. l.
- If you didn't know: Praděd is stupidly high (4895 ft a. s. l.) and biking there is hard
- One of Michael's rear braking pads fell out. Just like that. Completely-out-of-the-blue!
- Problems with brakes slow us down more than slowing down with actual working brakes
- We beg all the breaking pads, not to jump out again. Especially when we're going 30 mph down the mountain
- It was super hot the whole day but it just started raining really heavily
- Michael apparently trapped a slug in his poncho a couple days ago and it has died in there and smelled… well, like a dead slug would smell
- Michael washed the poncho in a local stream across the road and sprayed the poncho with deodorant
- It's in pristine condition now and smells like a cheap parfume store
- We successfully arrived to Rýmařov where we built a full-fledged bunker out of hammocks and tarps
