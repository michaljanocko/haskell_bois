- Breakfast at the hostel was scrumptious
- First 1.5 miles were up a big stupid hill
- Michal's brakes brake (even when they're not supposed to brake)
- Lots of bridges
- Bike shop not found, Jirka has to wait for his kickstand
- We climbed _Klínovec_ (4081 ft a. s. l.)
- In a few days, Michal's super-cheap panniers are gonna fall off
- One of the pannier's rain cover misses 3" on all sides (surprisingly, the other one fits pretty well)—we're taping plastic bags all around it but they hold water instead of repelling it
- Burgers were yummy too
- Stupid hills, again
- In spite of Michal's efforts, his shoes have been wet for three days already
- Jirka has touch hallucinations
- We make motorcycle sounds when acceleraing (we're fine… ?)
- First night out in the wild is ahead of us
- Dead mosquito is the best mosquito
- Our filter is a miracle: it turns unidentifiable brown liquids into water
- The filter is clogged
- Plastic bottle serves as a decent shower
- Our kill rate is not enough—seems like the mosquitos are reproducing fast
- We would definitely enact a mosquito one-child policy
- Jirka bought sausages (and they're good)
- The green candy has the best flavor
