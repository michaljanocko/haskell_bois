- We left at noon. Yup, at noon.
- We climbed the largest hill we've ever done on a bike
- It took us three hours
- Average incline was over 15%
- Expensive lunch at the Slaměnka hotel
- We were followed by a group of elderly people
- Our map app is showing off its terrible routes. It's not even funny anymore
- Michal's carrier rack's bolt has broken off
- We wired back together
- After a few miles, it literally fractured so we splinted it with tape
- The durability of this solution met our expectations—1000 ft further, we found ourselves solving the same problem
- There was only one way to solve that: get rid of the rack
- We taped some bags to the handlebar, some to the frame, Michal had something on a shoulder strap and the rest was just hanging from the bike
- The way down to Ramzová was beautiful
- We arrived to Jirka's grandparents place at exactly 11 PM
