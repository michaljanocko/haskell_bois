- We underestimated how cold it gets in the night
- We did a good deed—we took down an SPD poster (a right-wing populist party)
- Speed of 33 mph was reached!
- The lunch was… well, weird and our stomachs felt that as well
- Riding >38 miles or more through the mountains is no joke
- Everything hurts
- George's bike doesn't work properly
- Michael's bike makes weird sounds and we don't know why
- George's mosquito bite is getting worse and worse (hopefully, it was a mosquito)
- We bought milk—yes, the container cracked on the way
- We eat too much candy
- There are very soft and large beds in the hostel
- We tried out some protein shakes (chocolate coconut and banana flavors)
- First bag of American jerky has been opened
