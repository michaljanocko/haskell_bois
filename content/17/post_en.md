- We finally finished all the carrots that we had since we were in Trutnov
- Michael's knot for fastening a plastic bottle to the carrier rack is approaching perfection (after countless absolutely terrible variations)
- We're eating string cheese while riding. It sits well in a bag in the bike frame
- "Not gonna lie…"
- "Yeah, same"
- "Giddy up" made a comeback
- The map app is back at it again; we're trying to get our bikes up a steep incline through tall grass
- We're out of water
- We found the Ondrášovka spring; George liked it
- The "R-klub" reastaurant in Moravský Beroun received our worthless prize—our recommendation (seriously, it was pretty good)
- Of course, we forgot to fill our bottles
- In comparison to what we've been through, local hills are more like bumps on the road
- First flat tire (Michael's rear wheel)
- We got a refill from a guy at his cabin who warned us about the non-potable water we were filling our bottles with. I think we've drunk much worse "liquids" and we still have plenty of Imodium
- George's been stung by nettles (a lot)
- Seeing asphalt and proper roads after so long is a transcendental experience
- We're sleeping on a hill
