- We're sleeping in
- Lunch again at grandma's
- We didn't leave todayâ€”we're waiting for Jirka's full recovery
- Michal rode his motorcycle after a year
- Our dinner was protein bomb: pork and eggs
- The phonograph is playing Olympic, Modern Talking, and The Police
- There's thunder outside and lightnings light up our surroundings with the brightness of daylight
- It's raining
- Good night
