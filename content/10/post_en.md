- We started out slow
- Jirka didn't feel well so we only reached the first restaurant
- We decided that this is gonna be our rest day
- Some lady kicked us out of "her" land
- The land was owned by the town, and even if it was hers, she technically had no right to kick us out (we found out too late)
- Dear Ms. X, if your cows care that we're sitting on public grassland, they can start civil proceeding through the court system of the Czech Republic
- Since 5 PM we're resting in a "govt. owned" forest which is probably going to be our sleeping spot

- No pictures today, because there was nothing to take pictures of
