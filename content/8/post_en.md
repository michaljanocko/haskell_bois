- Our maps are picking even worse routes than yesterday (see pic. #2)
- George's chain keeps falling off the gears and his carrier rack cracked and broke
- A nice guy, in front of whose house we've stopped, seems to have more stuff than Home Depot
- We made some goulash soup
- Michael stepped barefoot on a slug

- We saw 1 Russian, 2 Belgian, and 5 Dutch license plates so far. We're not even counting German, Polish, and (of course) Czech plates.
