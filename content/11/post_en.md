- Michael stepped into an anthill with his left foot
- We're once again a bit smarter: ant's sting might disappear quickly but boy does it itch, hurt, and swell
- George is still not in the best condition
- We changed our intentions and headed towards the closest town/city (Dobruška)
- Downhill all the way
- In Dobruška, we had a meal and watched some DVTV interviews
- Then, we waited for Michael's family to pick up George. He's gonna rest at their cabin which should have been an all-night stop on the route either way.
- The large-sized ice-cream is really big here
- The only entertainment was the internet and a fountain with a granite sphere that weighed almost a tonne but could still be spun around
- With a three-hour delay, the blue car honked and George was picked up
- Farewell, George. We'll see each other tomorrow at our cabin.

- Now it's just me
- Near the city, almost everybody mows the lawn today. Is it like their favorite pastime or what?
- Luisa's valley on a hill. WTF
- It's getting dark pretty quickly
- My bike's headlight ran out of battery so I had to use my head-mounted thingy
- I made the remaining 16 mi and the vast majority of today's elevation in 2.5 hours
- Never again
- Finding a place to sleep in the woods when it's pitch dark is about as bad as it sounds
- Showering is even worse
- I'm not even a mile from the summit of Velká Deštná
- My dinner consisted of a granola bar and a cup of yoghurt; I'm looking forward to breakfast
- Here, in the wild, I'm listening to Olympic and Helena Vondráčková (you guys don't probably know them, don't look it up)

- Dear readers, I'm gonna go to bed soon so I wish a pleasant evening and a good night
