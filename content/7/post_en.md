- We didn't really feel like going anywhere today
- We left extremely late (at 2 PM!)
- No kickstand fits Jirka's bike frame
- We filled our stomach at _Mašek's bakery_ – 10/10, would recommend
- The road to Harrachov was only uphill
- The road from Harrachov was… well, only uphill too
- The map app picks terrible routes which take 3–4× longer than the equivalent via an actual paved road
- The three reasons mentioned above cut our average speed down to 4.7 mph and that's why 20 miles took us 5.5 hours
- We're sleeping in the _Krkonoše National Park_

- We're extending our election programme to include revitalisation of _Krkonoše mountains_ to the _Krkonoše plain_

- Last, we will share with you, dear reader, our travelers' trick which has been kept secret since the beginning of our journey:
  1. Take a plastic bottle filled with water
  2. Loosen the cap by 1–1.5 turns
  3. Point the top of the bottle towards the ground
  4. Gently squeeze the bottle
  5. Now, you can wash your hands without wasting too much water but still having the right amount and not just a couple of drops.

- Sorry for not posting yesterday. There was no reception in our foresty bedroom.
