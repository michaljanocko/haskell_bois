- We woke up at lunch time
- We visited three bikestores
- Michael bought a rack that he hopes will last a lifetime (or at least more than the previous one) since he will probably have to sell his kidney for it
- George didn't buy a new kickstand; he's gonna give a second chance to the old one
- We washed all the mud away off of our bikes and all the traumas from the previous day with it
- George's grandpa has a water power plant (and it's even cooler than it sounds)
- The trout, which was for dinner, was salvation
- We're ready to tackle the highest mountain summit on our journey tommorow
